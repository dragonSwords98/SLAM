# SLAM
Following Along with geohot's livecoding session where he built a toy version of SLAM.

Effectively introducing me to SLAM, essential and fundamental matrices, using python, ruby, C++ to build an openGL environment, and corner and feature detection with OpenCV.

* SDL for 2D Display, pangolin for 3D display
* cv2 for feature extraction
* numpy to organize matrices and points
* openGL to draw + show points and lines in pangolin
* multiprocessing for queuing the frame by frame
